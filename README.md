Contents:

1. Data Mining w/o Programming - How common data mining tasks can be accomplished without programming by using Orange to construct visual data mining flows.

2. Orange: Data Mining Toolbox in Python - Orange is a machine learning and data mining suite for data analysis through Python scripting and visual programming.

3. Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining in Practice: A Systematic Literature Review of Empirical Evidence - Examined the literature on experimental case studies conducted in the domain during the past six years (2008-2013).

4. A One-hour Curriculum to Engage Middle School Students in Robotics and Computer Science using Cubelets - A pre-test and a post-test administered to middle school students.

5. GENERATING BICYCLIST COUNTS USING VOLUNTEERED AND PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THROUGH A MOBILE APPLICATION - BCApp (Bicyclists Count App) was created with the Google Android software development kit (SDK).  Used Python script to connect to Parse.com to get the BCApp table, used the Parse REST Application Programming Interface (API, Parse 2014b). This REST API gives users the opportunity to download, upload, or query Parse tables.  Next, the Python script pulled the necessary fields, including the latitude and longitude of the post, out of the table and places them into a JSON file. Finally, the Python script formated the JSON file so that its contents can be displayed on top of the Google heatmap.
